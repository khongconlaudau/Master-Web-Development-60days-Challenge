***Casecading Style Sheets***

Casecade helps to chose what rules to apply when there are multiple rules applied to a element.

Rule (4). POSITION
Eg: li{
    color: green;
    color: blue;
}
li{
    color: red;
}
-- The lower, the more important -> apply color to red

Rule (3). SPECIFICITY
Eg: li {color: blue;}                       (4) Element Selector
    .first_class {color: red;}              (3) Class Selector
    li[draggable] {color: purple;}          (2) Attribute Selector
    #first-id {color: orange;}              (1) Id Selector

- (1) is the most important and following up. So the color will be orange

Rule (2). TYPE
  (1) Inline 
  (2) Internal 
  (3) External
- (1) is the most important and following up


Rule (1). IMPORTANCE
Eg: color: red;
    color: lightblue !important;        

the rule applied will be the one have "!important". The previous rules does not matter any more


*** We can have mult class by adding space between them
Eg: <h1 class="a-class another-class">Hello</h1>

.a-class{
    color: green;
}                               (Using Position)
.another-class{
    color: blue;
}
