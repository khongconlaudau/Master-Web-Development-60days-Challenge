*****   Positioning     *****

1. STATIC (HTML Default Flow)
- the position of the next element goes below the previous element.
- Even if we try to add relative postion (left: 50px; top: 100px;), it will not change anything

2. Relative:
- Postion relative to default position
Eg Syntax:
    position: relative;
    left: 50px;
    top: 100px;

3. ABSOLUTE:
- Makes the position relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
- if there is no position ancestor: -> default: top left conner of webpage
*** Important the ancestor position has to be relative position


*** Z index ***
- Z index determines which elements go on top of which in the Z-axis (Does not work with ABSOLUTE POSITION or have to set z-idex: -1;)
